webconfig
=========

Enables & starts httpd service and allows the http port on the firewall. The index.html is then deployed while using variables defined in the roles defaults directory. 

(Ensure the webconfig_role.yml playbook embedded within the playbook_collection_5 folder is used alongside this role)
